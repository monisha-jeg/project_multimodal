# Multimodal Dialogue Systems

The models in this repository are written for the multimodal dialogue system simulated by the [MMD Dataset](https://amritasaha1812.github.io/MMD/).

The components of this project include the following:
* Integration of domain-relevant features that improves the performance of image retrieval 
* Explores the performance of attention and memory-based models along with domain knowledge integration
* Explores the use of Graph Convolutional Networks
